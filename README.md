# Image_Scraping_with_python
You might be wondering “Hey Shashank, why in the world are you talking about scraping images?” Great question. 
The reason is because image acquisition is one of the most under-talked about subjects in the computer vision field! Think about it. 
Whether you’re leveraging machine learning to train an image classifier, building an image search engine to find relevant images in a 
collection of photos, or simply developing your own hobby computer vision application — it all starts with the images themselves.  
And where do these images come from? Well, if you’re lucky, you might be utilizing an existing image dataset like CALTECH-256, ImageNet, 
or MNIST. 
But in the cases where you can’t find a dataset that suits your needs (or when you want to create your own custom dataset), 
you might be left with the task of scraping and gathering your images. While scraping a website for images isn’t exactly a computer vision
technique, it’s still a good skill to have in your tool belt. I’ll show you how to use Beautiful Soup and the Python programming language
to scrape images from webpages.
